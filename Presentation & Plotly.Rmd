## Peer-graded Assignment: R Markdown Presentation & Plotly

# Instructions

Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a plot created with Plotly. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

# Plot

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
```

```{r}
library(gapminder)

p <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year==1997) %>%
  ggplot( aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop, color=continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()

ggplotly(p)
```
